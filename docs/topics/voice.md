# Voice

An implementation of Discord's [Voice Connection](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections).

Kord Voice acts as the middleman between Discord and your audio.

You may want to use something like [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer),
to deal with getting proper audio. The example will use LavaPlayer to get audio.
However, anything that can output 20ms of Opus-encoded 48k stereo audio
data should work fine.
